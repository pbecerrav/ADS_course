# CAS Applied Data Science Material

Personal (PBecerra) repository for the CAS Applied Data Science program, taken at the University of Bern during the 2023 - 24 academic year.

Structure is based on the lead instructor's Git Repo (see below), and is as follows: 
1. Module 1: Data Acquisition and Management 
2. Module 2: Statistical Inference for Data Science
3. Module 3: Data Analysis and Machine Learning
4. Module 4: Ethics and Best Practices
5. Module 5: Consolidations
6. Module 6: Deep Learning

All module folders are different from the originally provided files as they include personal notes and edits taken during class. Module folders also include the individual Module Project folders where applicable (e.g. Module2/project)
